I am changing this project to be a tech test gallery so I may share code samples on my job hunt.

- Add DND API with promise

# Stack 
- React
- React Router
- TypeScript
- Webpack
- Styled Components

# App Hierarchy

# Before Deploying 
- React Router: I may need to configure the production server to support client side routing (https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#serving-apps-with-client-side-routing)
- Lazy load with router - https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/dev/examples/lazy-loading/src/App.tsx
